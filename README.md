## *. Vertices

In Unity any mesh is made of points called vertizes representing a position in the world.

## *. Quad

A quad is made of 4 vertices. It is represented by an vertex array

Having the points isn't enough in unity we need to fill them out with tirangles



## *. Creating a Mesh

Create a empty object and first add a "Mesh Filter" component and then a "Mesh Renderer Component"
